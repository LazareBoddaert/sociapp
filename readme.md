This is a demo of a social app made by following tutorial from JavaScript Mastery (https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_shareme_social_media) whith few updates and modifications.

I followed this tutorial to learn/practice React.


For people trying to redo this tutorial, I add commentaries in my code to show what I updated, but I may have forgot some changes.
I also made few visual changes, like the logo and the categories.

Updates :
- Sanity (v3)
- Google OAuth 2.0 (+ jwt-decode)
- Add Craco


Other changes :
tailwind.config.js
